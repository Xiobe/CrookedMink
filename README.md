# CrookedMink

## Introduction
Project CrookedMink is a discovery script for Windows hosts. The script can be used in multiple ways, as a discovery during a pentest or a red|purple team assignment or for troubleshooting purposes in day to day IT work.

## Pentest / Red|Purple Team work
The output files are the output returned as by the command, not parsing. The File name is tagged by the MITRE ATT&CK technique.

## Troubleshooting
IT troubleshooting is often hard because you are missing context, the idea is that this script will run a lot of standard commands to discover the context you are working in. Yes, this is what we do for establishing context during an offensive mission too.

## Blue Team work
If you read the text above, you will get it by now. The commands are dual use, offensive and day to day IT which makes your job harder but read it as more interesting. You can use this as a reference both for looking into cases and establishing a baseline.
